## How to run it
___
First, clone the repository
1. `git clone https://github.com/juancsr/quasar-attack-operation.git`
2. or use go package manager `go get -u github.com/juancsr/quasar-attack-operation`

**Note**: *The following commands I assume you're on the root folder project*

### Runing by Go
___
Once you're on the root project folder you need to download all of the dependecies in the mod file, type:

`$ go mod download`

Just in case, run the `tidy` option, just to be sure that remove unused packages:

`$ go mod tidy`

If the two upper commands were right, run the main file to start the gin server:

`go run main.go`

### Running by docker-compose
___
Make sure you have docker and docker compose installed on your machine.
 (You can very this by simple running the version commands for the two of them):

 ```
 $ docker version
 Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           20.10.5
 API version:       1.41
 Go version:        go1.13.15
 ....

 $ docker-compose version
 docker-compose version 1.28.6, build 5db8d86f
docker-py version: 4.4.4
CPython version: 3.7.10
...
 ```

On the root folder just type: 

`$ docker-compose up`

This will create two containers, one for the project and another one for the mongodb database connection.

### Running using the air development tool (Docker need it)
___
For more info about the air tool for live reloading check out the official repository: https://github.com/cosmtrek/air

**This one is the best approach for a development environment.**

On the project folder run: 

```
$ docker run -ti --rm  \
    -w $(pwd) -v \
    $(pwd):$(pwd) \
    -p 9000:8080 \
    -e GIN_MODE=debug \
    -e USER=<user> \
    -e PASSWORD=<password> \
    -e DB=<db_name> \
    -e CLUSTER=<db_host> \
    cosmtrek/air
```

**Note**: _This is project needs environment variables, so make sure you havo those into your machine_

- **USER**

- **PASSWORD**

This is the user's password for the authentication database
